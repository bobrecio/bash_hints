Try out Ubuntu
...without installing
===

Recommendations for trying out Ubuntu:
- Run it from a USB
- Investigate comparable apps to what you use daily...Word processor, spreadsheet, powerpoint, browser, editor, calculater, notepad, Email client
- Don't configure an email client while testing
- Don't worry about learning the command line
- For everything... Google is  your friend

Here are the steps...
1. Download the Ubuntu desktop iso from Ubuntu site
    - https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
    - Recommend running 18.04.3 - it's more stable
3. Create USB with Balena Etcher
    - https://www.balena.io/etcher/
5. Reboot computer with USB plugged in 
    - Might have to hit the F12 key repeatedly to get boot device menu
7. Allow Ubuntu to boot
    - Select the option to try out Ubunutu
10. Connect to WiFi, if you're not connected by cable
1. Take it for a spin
12. Use Firefox to get to Google and other resources
13. If you like it, install it
    - Recommend installing to a whole hard drive until you are comfortable
    - Eventually, you can install the core files to one partition and the home directory on a seperate partition using the advanced method

Remember that any configuration changes that you make are only saved for the current session. So don't bother customizing too much until you have installed Ubuntu. But don't hesitate to see how much you can customize.

Along the same line, browser cache won't be saved, either. Therefore, even if you don't install it, you might want to keep the USB. Some folks use a USB like this to do banking and other sensitive transactions, so that their username and passwords will not be cached in their browser.
